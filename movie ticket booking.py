# 4. Movie Ticket Booking Simulation
# Simulate a movie theater booking system that:
# Shows a list of available movie titles, showtimes, and seat prices.
# Asks the user to choose a movie and number of tickets.
# Confirms total price and asks if they want to book another movie.
# Ends when they say ‚Äúno‚Äù and displays total bookings and cost.
# Skills practiced: loops, input, conditionals, calculations, nested dictionaries

# Define available movies with showtimes and prices

    2: {"title": "The Matrix", "showtime": "7:30 PM", "price": 12.50},
    3: {"title": "Interstellar", "showtime": "9:00 PM", "price": 11.00},
